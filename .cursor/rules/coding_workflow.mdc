# Coding Orchestration Rules (Frontend)

## When to Code vs. When to Ask

The user decides when **coding** (source code changes) happens. This project is a **separate entity**; changes here do not require changes in any backend unless the user says so.

### What Counts as "Coding" (Requires Permission)
- Modifying .tsx, .ts, .css, or config that affects build/runtime
- Creating new components, pages, or utilities
- Changing routing or API client usage
- Updating dependencies or Vite/TS config

### What Does NOT Require Permission
- Updating documentation (.md, .mdc) or Cursor rules
- Writing explanations or proposals
- Fixing lint/formatting errors in code you were asked to change

### Code ONLY When You See Explicit Instructions
- "Implement this", "Add this", "Fix this", "Create this"
- "Go ahead and code", "Proceed with [task]", "Start coding"

### DO NOT Code When
- User only asks a question or describes a problem without asking for a change
- User says "What do you think?" or "How should we handle this?"
- During review unless user asks to implement feedback

### When Unsure
1. Explain the approach.
2. Ask: "Should I proceed with implementing this?"
3. Wait for clear approval.
